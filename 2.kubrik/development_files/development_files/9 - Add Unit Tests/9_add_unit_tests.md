Add Tests

### Summary
Add test to enhance data quality of the project. Unit tests are capable of testing the logic of your code by using mock values.
It's used to test the 'logic' of your underlying code, rather than the values of it i.e. we mock up the behaviour of the relevant model
And establish an expectation based on what we would expect it to return.
